haskell provides predefined basic types for:
- booleans (Bool)
- integers (Int, Integer)
- reals (Float, Double)
- characters (Char)

each type provides its own logical, arithmetic, and relational operations

notes:
- negative numbers must be in parentheses
- `mod` and `rem` work differently with negative numbers (rem will return negative if theres negative)
- it is written /= and not !=
