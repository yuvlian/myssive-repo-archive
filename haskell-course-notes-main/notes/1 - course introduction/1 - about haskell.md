haskell is a pure programming language

there are not:
- assignments
- loops
- side effects (i dont really understand what this is)
- explicity memory management

there are:
- lazy evaluation (this means only evaluated if access)
- static type system (if something is string, it will always be string)
- automatic type inference (if not explicitly given type, type will be inferred)
- functions as first order objects (idk what this means)
